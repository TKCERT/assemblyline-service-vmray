# VMRay service

VMRay is a malware analysis platform that uses a hypervisor-based sandbox environment to study the behavior of malicious files, URLs, and email attachments. Its agentless approach allows for a more stealthy analysis, reducing the chances of malware detecting it's in a sandbox. This results in detailed insights into malware operations, making it easier to identify threats.
